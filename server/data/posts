In this article I will explore things that you should know about when arriving to Tokyo for your exchange and how you can prepare for some things.</p> \n<p>I'm having a hard time balancing writing about my experiences, keeping it informative for future exchange students and also informative in general for Tokyo or Japan so please bear with me while I find a comfortable format for the first few posts.</p>\n\n<p><h3>Airport - money, mobile data, trains and accommodation</h3>\nI hope you will arrive to Narita airport, since if you don't I have almost no advice regarding your airport. When you arrive you will need some yen. Go ahead and exchange some euros at any banks exchange booth. If you didn't bring euros or yen then I hope you know what you are doing. My next article will talk about cash in more detail.</p>\n<p>The first time I traveled Japan in 2015 for three weeks I didn't buy a prepaid data plan.For me just using accommodation and station wifis was enough to save routes, attractions and other things on my phone for offline use. This time around since I was coordinating with my friend upon my arrival I wanted to be online. In Narita airport you can buy 7-30 day prepaid sim cards and pocket wifis. In my opinion they seem really expensive and that's why I took only a 7 day 2GB sim card for 3000 yen. After it expired I have not bought a new one. I will still keep an eye out for some deals and ask locals for some advice and I will maybe update here if I find some reasonable plans.</p>\n<p>Narita airport is quite far away from Tokyo central and especially Hachioji where Tokyo national college of technology is located. I would recommend two options to go to Tokyo, one expensive and fast the other one cheap and slow. A third unrecommended option and the one I took unfortunately is the JR Narita express, which is both expensive(3000+) AND slow(80 min to Shinjuku). Skyline is around 2400 yen and will take you around 40 minutes to Nippori station. The cheaper route is a local train by the same company that will cost you around 1000 yen to Nippori but take around 80 minutes. Your choice of train should depend on your schedule and where you will stay the next night. The two faster trains mentioned above need a seat ticket to be purchased. In any case you should find a ticket machine and purchase an IC card with a few thousand yen charged. IC cards will let you travel carefree without buying tickets just by beeping them by the train gates and having them automatically charge you for your commutes. In some places you can also pay with IC cards such as most vending machines at train stations.</p>\n<p>If you want to stay at the campus dorm the first night I suggest arriving early in the morning on a regular weekday. In other cases you might need other accommodation for a day or two. For arrivals later than 18:00 I would suggest staying the first night in a hotel in Narita.</p>"},{"width":"normal","content":"<p><h3>The school dormitory</h3>\nIf you have read some student experiences from Tokyo you might have encountered some horror stories about the dormitory rules, and when you receive the rules many of them will have you question your exchange decision. But fear not, I'm here to tell you that the boys dorm is actually contrary to any of my expectations a very nice place.</p>\n<p>The boys dorm is located close to the school gates and is 4 floors high. All rooms I have seen are private rooms for one person. Every floor has a bathroom area with washing machines and dryers. The shower rooms are on the other side of the building. The dorm has a pretty fast internet connection but many ports seem to be blocked which makes it inconvenient for many things such as ssh, gaming and other things that require ports to be open. If you want wifi you need to have a router.</p>\n<p>The only two important rules aside from common sense seem to be that there is no alcohol allowed in the dorm and that you need to be present at 22:00 for the row call unless you have applied for a leave or informed by calling that you are late. Applying for a leave is simple and there is no questions asked even for longer periods. I would suggest anyone who is coming for exchange to take advantage of the school dormitory.</p>\n<p>Most of the people who live in the dorms are Japanese but some were from other Asian countries as well. There is three of us from Metropolia exchanging here and we are the only exchange students right now. We live close to each other in the dorms but research in different departments.</p>\n<img src=\"/roomview.jpg\" alt=\"View from the dorm window\">\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">View from the dorm room window</div>"},{"width":"normal","content":"<p><h3>The campus</h3>\nThe closest station to the school is Hazama that can be reached by the Keio line from Shinjuku. The Keio line is very convenient because it has many express trains that make it fast to get around. From Hazama to Shinjuku it takes about 50minutes.</p>\n<p>The campus is quite large but not too big. There are two restaurants, the dorm restaurant and the school restaurant. Dorm restaurant is only for people who live in the dorms and has 3 meals a day. You need to sign up for 1 month of meals per time. I signed up for the lunch only for the first month. The school restaurant has rather cheap and good food during lunchtime. There is also a small convenience store. There is a lot of different club activities and sports you can participate in such as football, baseball, basketball, table tennis, tennis, judo and more.</p>\n\n<p><h3>The first week</h3>\nWhen we arrived we were a little bit surprised by how little things were planned for us. For the first few days we only had one small thing to do per day and some days nothing at all. We spent the remaining time settling in at our dorms, exploring the area, getting to know people at the campus and having fun. This week my research project will start and we will go set up our bank accounts for the scholarship.</p>"}],"_id":"AQY4iDQRXY5xtHcJ"}

I initially planned on having my exchange in South Korea because I was interested in studying in a completely foreign country and culture. The school in Seoul didn't seem to have many courses in English and most courses seemed to be for beginners which gave me doubts and I ended up changing the location to Tokyo. Changing was still possible even after the confirmation from Seoul had arrived. The reason I chose Tokyo instead was that a classmate of mine was also going there and the content of the exchange might be more appropriate for me. The application process was very straight forward so I will not go into detail about that.</p>\n\n<p>The exchange period is 4 months from October to February and the school is located in Hachioji, Tokyo. The content of the exchange is primarily a research project which I will write more about when I have the details.</p>\n\n<p>I will look forward for the start of my exchange and record my experiences here.</p>"}],"_id":"hs6MIb5cbk3SQUUa"}
