I initially planned on having my exchange in South Korea because I was interested in studying in a completely foreign country and culture. The school in Soul didn't seem to have many courses in English and most courses seemed to be for beginners which gave me doubts and I ended up changing the location to Tokyo. Changing was still possible even after the confirmation from Soul had arrived. The reason I chose Tokyo instead was that a classmate of mine was also going there and the content of the exchange might be more appropriate for me. The application process was very straight forward so I will not go into detail about that.</p>\n\n<p>The exchange period is 4 months from October to February and the school is located in Hachioji, Tokyo. The content of the exchange is primarily a research project which I will write more about when I have the details.</p>\n\n<p>I will look forward for the start of my exchange and record my experiences here.</p>"}],"_id":"hs6MIb5cbk3SQUUa"}
